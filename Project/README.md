# Projects

This semester you will build a bot that provides a service in support of a software engineering task. There are many ways to design and interact with a bot -- but the main constraint is that it has to deal with as a primary concern something that is a software development concern, like testing software, and not a general one, like ordering takeout.

### Teams

Students shall form teams of size 4-5. No more, no less without instructor approval.

### Milestones

You will deliver your project in 5 milestones, which will include a design, a bot component, a service component, a deployment component, and a final report and video demo.

Milestones generally prescribe a set of high-level design goals, giving much freedom in how you satisfy the goals as long as the meet the required criteria.

Details will emerge throughout the semester, but the following will give you a rough outline of the expected work.

##### Design

The design phase is about thinking through what you want to build. There will be design materials that will help you reason about your idea. Although your implementation may stray from your design, you'll to have stay within the parameters of your original idea. So make sure you get this right.

##### Bot

A primary mechanism for interaction with a service will be through a bot. How will that work? Figure out the home platform for the bot (slack, facebook messenger, kik, github webhooks, etc.). How do you get it to do what you want.

##### Service

What does your bot help you do? What's a common pain point of a software developer?

Some areas that could be of interest:

* Configuration management
* Unit tests
* Test coverage
* Build server
* Static analysis tools
* Parsing code
* Collecting metrics
* Interactions with runtime operations, infrastructure (feature flags)
* Monitoring, analysis

##### Deployment

You must be able to deploy your code to some hosted service, using configuration management, and orchestration of services.

##### Report

You must create a report that describes your entire project from design to implementation and a demo video demostrating your bot in action.
