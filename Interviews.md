We will practice a remote technical interview.

1. [Sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfR2p4gKynzrOtYmqWA5g4VtVVfoYBv2Uf6v-VTSU4o/edit) with a partner.
2. We will do two rounds.  Each round will last 30 minutes. There are 4 coding questions in the full interview.
3. Use chat/comments within google docs to communicate. Alternatively, you can use slack direct messages if that's not working.
4. After a round, we will spend 5 minutes to complete post interview survey and assessment.
5. Switch places.

### Round 1

Interviewer, paste the question inside the google form. Clarify any questions about the coding question, and then let the interviewee start coding.  Every 45seconds-1 minute, make sure to ask the developer how they are doing. This is an important part of a technical interview. Some questions you can ask during coding:

* What is your approach?
* Is there a better way to do this?
* Are there any edge cases you are missing?

Keep track of how long someone is spending on a question. If they do not seem like they will be able to solve the question and have already spent about 5-7 minutes, move on to next question.

##### Assessment Forms

After the 30 minutes is up, take the time to finish these surveys:
